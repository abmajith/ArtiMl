# ArtiMl
In this Project, you can find various matrix operations in the Matrix_Multiplication.c code
As of now, we have QR decompositon package was written, program correctness is double checked.
In the future we will add more experimental results using this code!

We have Spectral decomposition (eigen vectors) compuation code using QR algorithm written.

In this model, we are working towards various functions for machine learning models.
