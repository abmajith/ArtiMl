In this folder you can see the files to do the k-mean clustering with an example

in order to compile 

type the commad in terminal as 

gcc -Wall -o a test_k_centroid.c kmean_clustering.c -lm

Some terminal you have to explicitly ask the compiler to link the math library.


Caution: Dont't use for larger data sets, even the simple malloc usage will tell you whether you can load your full data sets while running.


In this folder, we have only simple (norm one) normalization of the data vectors of the data set.

One can use better normalization like guassian or normal distribution type by finding mean and standanrd deviaiton of each co-ordinate point of data vector of 
given data sets.

In the latter case we had to use the 'Mahalanobis distance' instead of norm 2 distance to find the k-centroids and associated clusters

Note: Mahalanobis dist: sqrt([vec(x) - mean(data)]^{T} S^{-1} [vec(x) - mean(data)]) where S is the co-variance matrix of dimension d times d,
meand(data) an array of length d.
