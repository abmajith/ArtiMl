In this folder, you can have simple exhaustive querry search for the arbitary k- nearest neighbourhood. In the upcoming days, we will update 
the c code to querry and normalize clever way like loading from the file rather than preloaded data in the ram. 

Also, we are thinking about implementing the hash collision method to find the k nearest neighbour instead of linear search.

To run the test code follow the terminal command as 

gcc -Wall -o a -Wall test_knn.c knn.c  -lm
./a (to see the output)
